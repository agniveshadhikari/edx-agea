\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Current state of online learning:}
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is overpowered the area of online education everywhere.Professors from world class 
institutes are making online content *(and assessments) available both in free and (increasingly) paid courses. Renowned
institutions are accepting these credits as part of their curriculum.MOOC learning currently revolves around videos, text
and images used by students to grab the subjective knowledge which is then assessed by subjective,objective or numerical 
based tests.In the US, school education is undergoing a transformation. More and more schools are adopting hybrid models 
of learning over the traditional classroom based (rote) approach.Assessment of learning is a weak area especially in MOOCs 
where physical assessment is impossible. In the hybrid models as well, physical assessments (as against the e-Assessments) 
bring in a subjective element. An e-Assessment has the risk of large scale 'copying' thus is not an appropriate parameter of
judging the concepts of student.

\section{edX Platform}

edX is a massive open online course (MOOC) provider.It hosts online university level courses in a wide range of disciplines
to a worldwide student body, including some courses at no charge. It also conducts research into learning based on how people 
use its platform.EdX differs from other MOOC providers such as coursera or Udacity,in that it is a non profit organization and 
runs on the open edX open-source software.\\
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University created edX in May 2012.More than 70 schools,non profit 
organizations, and corporations offer to plan to offer courses on the edX website.As of 29 December,2016, edX has around 10
million students taking more than 1270 courses online.

\section{XBlocks}

XBlock is the SDK for the edX MOOC platform,written in python2 and announced and released publicly on March 14,2013.It aims 
to enable the global software developement community to participate in the construction of edx educational platform and the
next generation of online and blended courses.\\
XBlock is a component architecture that enables developers to create independent course components, or XBlocks, that are able 
to work seamlessly with other components in the construction and presentation of an online course. Course authors are able to 
combine XBlocks from a variety of sources — from text and video to sophisticated wiki-based collaborative learning environments
and online laboratories — to create rich engaging online courses.

\section{Objective}
The purpose of our project is to create an exam system in which the teacher uploads a question
paper written in the excel file in a certain format and the student uploads his answer file in the same format.
The answer file of the student is then automatically graded.The student can also see his progress in the progress bar.

\section{Purpose}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To enhance the platform of IIT BombayX.
\item To reduce the workload of the teacher when large number of students are present.
\end{enumerate}
\section{The future of learning in the world:}
In the future with advanced technology, we can allow not only excel files but also text,image and other possible files.

\section{Scope of Project}
This system will be Excel Sheet Management System for a School/University. This
system will be designed to maximize the examination productivity by providing tools to
assist in automating the correction of answer sheets and publishing grade process, which
would otherwise have to be performed manually.
This system can be quite useful in accounting exams and also in other exams which can involve excel comparisons.

\chapter{Overview of the entire project}

\section{Use case Diagram}
\includegraphics[totalheight=10cm]{bruh}
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpg,.png}


The system has two views-Teacher view and Student view.The teacher uploads an
annotated question template which is then downloaded by the student.The student fills in
the answers and uploads his answer template which is then automatically graded and can
be viewed both by the teacher and the student.

\section{Functional Requirements Specification-Student's View}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Teacher uploads annotated question file.
\item Student downloads the file (from the student view).
\item Student solves the problem, makes changes to the annotated file, and uploads the
answer script (from the student view).
\item Auto grader will run on the answer script. Grades will be computed.
\item The student can now view his grades.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Functional Requirements Specification-Teacher’s View}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Teacher upload the annotated question template and answer sheet.
\item Student download the annotated question paper.
\item Student solves the problem, makes changes to the annotated file, and uploads the
answer script (from the student view).
\item Auto grader will run on the answer script. Grades will be computed.
\item Both student and teacher can view the grade assigned to the student.
\item Teacher has the option to download the answer script.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

To use our system,the user must have edx platform installed in their local server.Also, the project 
preferebly runs on web browsers like google chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

\includegraphics[totalheight=6cm]{grades}
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpg,.png}
\end{enumerate}

\section{User Requirement}
The Student and the Teacher are expected to be Internet literate and be able to use a
search engine.

\chapter{Limitations}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The grading is based on cell comparison only.

\item All the files uploaded should be in xlsx format.

\item Also,there will be error if we duplicate sections or subsections.

\item There should not be any videos or pictures in the excel file.

\item The author view is not working.That is why we have shown the instructions(originally 
intented to be the content of the author view) is shown in the studio view.

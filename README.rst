3. Settings

	- Question Parameters:

		- Question title: This should be a short title to the question, and not the question statement itself. This
			text appears at various places such as the title of the tab or browser, or in the navigation pane. Recommended
			max length is 140 characters.

		- Question text: This text is the actual question. This can be elaborate, and there is no limit on the maximum length.
			Recommended max length is 500 characters. If the required question statement exceeds this limit, it is recommended
			that the question statement is included in the question file that is to be uploaded, and a shorter question text be
			put in this field.

		- Maximum score: This field requres you to enter the score you want students to be graded out of. This need not be the 
			maximum attainable score. The students will be assigned grade for this problem as a percentage out of this value.
			For example, if the maximum attainable score is 25 but you want any score above 20 to be given full credit (100% credit)
			for this problem, you enter the value 20 in this field. This value has to be an integer.

		- Problem Weight: This is the weightage of this problem in this assessment type. The sum of weightages of all
			problems in a particular assessment must be equal to 1. If you are unsure, we recommend you have this value as 1.0.
			This field accepts decimal values.

		- Maximum attempts permitted: This value corresponds to the maximum number of submission a student is allowed to make
			for this problem. Leave this value blank if you don't want to limit the number of submissions. Enter positive values
			only.

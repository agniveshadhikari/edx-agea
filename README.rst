Installation
------------

Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~

This module depends on the package ``openpyxl`` to be installed in the environment.
If this is already available, skip to the next section (Production Installation).

1. Ckecking if openpyxl is installed

   .. code:: sh

     "sudo -H -u edxapp bash"
     "source /edx/app/edxapp/edxapp_env"
     "python"

   .. code:: python

     ">>> import openpyxl"

   - If this runs successfully: you already have openpyxl installed. You can proceed to the
     actual product installation in the next subsection.

     Quit python shell by typing

     .. code:: python

       "quit()"

     Run the following command to return to the user ``edx``

     .. code:: sh

       "exit"

   - If not: run the command

     .. code:: python

       "quit()"

     and proceed with installing openpyxl.

2. Installing openpyxl

   You should still be logged in to user ``edxapp``. Run the following command

   .. code:: sh

     "sudo pip install openpyxl"

   This should automatically install openpyxl and all of its dependencies. It is recommeded 
   you return to Step 1 (above) to verify the package has indeed been installed correctly.

   Note: if there are further errors in installing openpyxl, please shoot a mail to 
   shreesubh.Zsarkar@gmail.com, removing the 'Z' in the mail id




Production Installation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2. Run the command

   .. code:: sh

   Verify that in ``/edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/lib/python2.7/site-packages/`` 
   a directory ``agea`` has now been created. If not, the installation has 
   not been successful.
